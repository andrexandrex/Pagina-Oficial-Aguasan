      <h2>What is a Biosand Filter?</h2>
      <p>A biosand filter is a simple water treatment device that uses sand, gravel, and biological processes to remove impurities from drinking water. It was developed in the 1990s by Dr. David Manz and Dr. John Lloyd, and is now used in many parts of the world to provide safe drinking water.</p>

    <section id="how">
      <h2>How does a Biosand Filter work?</h2>
      <p>Water is poured into the top of the filter, where it passes through a layer of gravel, a layer of fine sand, and a layer of coarse sand. Microorganisms that live in the sand and gravel help to break down and remove impurities from the water. The filtered water is then collected in a container at the bottom of the filter.</p>
